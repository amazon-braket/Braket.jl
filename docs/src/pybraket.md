# PyBraket 

`PyBraket.jl` is used to interface with the Python BDK to provide functionality that is not yet implemented in Julia.
Currently, there are two such features:

- Local simulation of analog Hamiltonian simulators (the `"braket_ahs"` local simulator)
- Unpickling of results from Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs
