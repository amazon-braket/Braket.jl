===================================
OpenPulse Python reference package
===================================

This package contains the reference abstract syntax tree (AST) for representing
OpenPulse programs, tools to parse text into this AST, and tools to manipulate
the AST.

The AST itself is in the :obj:`.ast` module.  There is a reference parser in the
:obj:`.parser` module, which requires the ``[parser]`` extra to be installed.

With the ``[parser]`` extra installed, the simplest interface to the parser is
the :obj:`~parser.parse` function.
